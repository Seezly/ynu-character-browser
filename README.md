# The Yofukashi no Uta Character Browser

## Why? Are you another weeb programmer?

***YES!***

No, I'm just kidding. I wanted to **learn React** so I just made this Character Browser by myself so I could learn developing a real project with certains features like ***filters***, ***a search tool***, ***handle clicks and changes***, ***making a fetch to an API made by me*** —*Soon I'll learn Express, so I just made a tiny data.json meanwhile*—, and so on, but focused more on components and React stuff than UX/UI and pretty-looking web. I just do the character browser based in the **Yofukashi no Uta** manga characters because I like the manga and also the art of the [mangaka](https://twitter.com/cot_510). The idea of making this show up in my head while reading it!

## How to start?

It's easy, just star the project —*optional*—, and clone it to your local machine.

Enter the project with your favorite IDE, open the terminal, enter the project directory, and just do:

`npm i`

This will install all the dependencies that the project needs to work.

Then:

`npm start`

To start the project on 3000 port.

***IMPORTANT: I did not make this project neither mobile-friendly or so. Please only view the projects on >=laptop view.***

***NOTE: This project doesn't reflect my HTML, CSS, responsive-design, mobile-friendly, SEO, UX/UI skills. It is just a React practice.***

***NOTE2: This project may or may not be improved (*better UX/UI, mobile-friendly, responsive design, SEO, performance, etc*). Please be aware of that, maybe if in the future there are more characters in the Yofukashi no Uta manga I will be improving this project.***
